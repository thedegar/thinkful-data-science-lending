Challenge:

Write a script called "prob_lending_club.py" that reads in the loan data, cleans it, and loads it into a pandas DataFrame. 
Use the script to generate and save a boxplot, histogram, and QQ-plot for the values in the "Amount.Requested" column. 
Be able to describe the result and how it compares with the values from the "Amount.Funded.By.Investors". 
Push your code to GitHub and enter the link below.


Observations:

The Amount Funded is much less than the Amount Requested.
    The center of the Amount Funded data is around 10k, while the center of Amount Funded is around 50k.
    The high side of Amount Funded has some flyers around 35k and a long tail on that side.
    The Amount Requested is evenly distributed and appears to be a uniform distribution.
        The boxplots, histogram and qq-plot all support this.
    The Amount Funded is closer to a normal distribution than the Amount Reqeusted, but it is has a long tail on the right side (high side)
